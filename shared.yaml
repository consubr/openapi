        At SumUp authentication uses your API credentials and Basic HTTP auth. The API credentials consist of a `client_id` and `client_secret` key-value pair.
        It is possible to create multiple API credentials for each of the applications you connect with your SumUp account.
        Use the API credentials as an authorization header for requests that require such.

        Authorization
        ---------
        SumUp uses the <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749' target='_blank'>OAuth 2.0 authorization framework</a> and supports <a href='https://developer.sumup.com/docs/authorization/#authorization-flows' target='_blank'>two authorization flows</a> for <a href='https://developer.sumup.com/docs/register-app/#3-create-oauth-client-credentials' target='_blank'>obtaining an access token</a>. 
        The flow you choose will grant your access token specific permissions. All API calls should include the obtained access token in the `Authorization: Bearer <<valid_access_token>>` format. 
        To complete successful requests, ensure you have requested the <a href='https://developer.sumup.com/docs/authorization/#authorization-scopes' target='_blank'>necessary scopes</a> for your authorization flow of choice.
